# Dependency Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup of dependencies after migrating from Authy to Twilio for MFA functionality.

## Changes Made

### Sample App Server (`sample-app/server/package.json`)

#### Removed Dependencies
The following dependencies were removed as they were not being used in the sample-app server:

1. **`authy-client`** - Removed from `optionalDependencies` (was already removed from main server)
2. **`node-fetch`** - Not used in sample-app server
3. **`express-validator`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)
4. **`log4js`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)
5. **`passport-oauth2`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)
6. **`qrcode`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)
7. **`speakeasy`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)
8. **`bcrypt`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)
9. **`axios`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server scripts/tests)
10. **`passport-local`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)
11. **`passport-local-mongoose`** - Not used in sample-app server (used only in main server)

#### Final Dependencies for Sample App Server
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "connect-mongo": "^5.0.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
    "ejs": "^3.1.8",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "express-session": "^1.17.3",
    "module-alias": "^2.2.3",
    "mongoose": "^6.8.0",
    "passport": "^0.6.0"
  },
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "twilio": "^4.19.0"
  }
}
```

### Main Server (`src/server/package.json`)
The main server dependencies were already cleaned up and only contain the necessary dependencies for the core functionality.

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed unused dependencies to reduce the overall package size
2. **Improved Security**: Removed potential security vulnerabilities from unused packages
3. **Cleaner Dependencies**: Only essential dependencies are now included
4. **Better Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update dependencies
5. **Faster Installation**: Reduced npm install time

## Verification

- ✅ All removed dependencies were verified to not be used in the sample-app server code
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Twilio integration maintained
- ✅ Authy dependencies completely removed

## Notes

- The main server (`src/server/`) already had the correct dependencies and didn't need changes
- All removed dependencies are still available in the main server where they are actually used
- The sample-app server now has a minimal, focused set of dependencies
- Twilio remains as an optional dependency for MFA functionality

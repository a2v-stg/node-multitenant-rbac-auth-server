# Rate Limiting Integration Complete! 🎉

The rate limiting middleware has been successfully integrated into your main application (`src/server/index.js`).

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. **Rate Limiting Applied to All Routes**
- Rate limiting is now automatically applied to all routes in your application
- Protects against DoS attacks and resource abuse
- Different limits for different types of operations

### 2. **Test Endpoints Available**
- `/test/rate-limit` - Test rate limiting functionality
- `/test/rate-limit/status` - Check current rate limit status
- `/test/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/test/auth-test` - Test authentication rate limiting
- `/test/api-test` - Test API rate limiting

### 3. **Configuration via Environment Variables**
- All rate limiting settings can be configured via `.env` file
- Environment-specific limits (development, staging, production)
- IP whitelisting and user agent filtering

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### Quick Test
```bash
cd src/server
npm run test:rate-limit
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
cd src/server
npm run test:rate-limit:full
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test basic rate limiting
curl http://localhost:3000/test/rate-limit

# Check rate limit status
curl http://localhost:3000/test/rate-limit/status

# Test multiple requests to trigger rate limiting
for i in {1..150}; do curl -s http://localhost:3000/test/rate-limit; done
```

## 🔒 Rate Limiting Applied

### General Protection
- **All Routes**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **API Endpoints**: 50 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **MFA Operations**: 3 attempts per 5 minutes per IP
- **Admin Operations**: 30 operations per 15 minutes per IP

### Speed Limiting
- Requests are gradually slowed down after thresholds
- Maximum delay of 20 seconds for excessive requests

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Rate Limit Headers
```
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200000
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded Response
```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.",
  "retryAfter": 900,
  "limit": 100,
  "remaining": 0,
  "resetTime": 1640995200000
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Middleware Order**: Rate limiting is applied BEFORE your routes
2. **IP Detection**: Automatically detects client IP addresses
3. **Environment Awareness**: Different limits for different environments
4. **Monitoring**: Logs rate limit violations and warnings
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize limits and exclusions

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (in .env)
```bash
# General settings
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
API_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=50

# Trust proxy (set to true if behind reverse proxy)
TRUST_PROXY=false

# Skip rate limiting for specific IPs
SKIP_RATE_LIMIT_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Console Logs
- Rate limit warnings when limits are approached
- Configuration confirmation messages
- Error logging for debugging

### Response Headers
- Rate limit information in all responses
- Remaining requests count
- Reset time information

## 🎯 CodeQL Issue Resolved

✅ **HTTP request handlers now have rate limiting protection**
✅ **Application is protected against DoS attacks**
✅ **Resource abuse is prevented**
✅ **Security vulnerability is addressed**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting Not Working
1. Check that your server is running
2. Verify environment variables are loaded
3. Check console logs for configuration messages
4. Ensure middleware is applied before routes

### Too Strict Limits
1. Adjust environment variables
2. Use environment-specific overrides
3. Test with different user roles

### Wrong IP Addresses
1. Set `TRUST_PROXY=true` if behind reverse proxy
2. Check `req.ip` vs `req.connection.remoteAddress`

## 🎉 Success!

Your application is now protected against:
- ✅ Denial-of-service attacks
- ✅ Brute force authentication attempts
- ✅ API abuse and scraping
- ✅ Resource exhaustion attacks
- ✅ Automated bot attacks

The rate limiting system automatically adapts to your environment and provides comprehensive protection while maintaining good user experience for legitimate users.
